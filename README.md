# Tic-Tac-Toe

A basic tic tac toe game in java.
Written using JFrame and action listener. 
bin contains compiled code.
src contains source java code.

bin contains an exe to run the code, and src contains a makefile for linux and an exe for windows to compile and create an exe that will run the compiled code.

I am sorry about the typos in the comments of the code.
